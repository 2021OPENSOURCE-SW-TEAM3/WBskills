If you want to get started adding some resources to `web-skills` you are very welcome to make a PR with the additions. I can't promise that every PR will get merged, but I'll try to respond to everyone. Here's a brief overview of the project:

1. Run `npm run s` to serve the website.
2. Get familiar with the structure of the data before getting your hands dirty. A skill is a part of an area, an area is a part of a collection.
3. You can find all of the data in the `data` folder.
4. In the `assets` folder you can find all of the images for the skills. The images follow a naming convention based on the collection and area the skill is a part of. As an example, the image for the skill "Relational Databases" which is a part of the area "Databases" which is a part of the collection "Databases & Servers" would be located at `/assets/databases-and-servers/databases/relational-databases.svg`.
